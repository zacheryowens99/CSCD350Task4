Test 4.1 notes

Overall seems to working correctly, but I did notice two issues when looking over the test results

1. There seems to be a problem with the dying and dead flags, after the third iteration of terminate (this only affects linear)

2. After terminate, the step should be cut in half after the step has been taken (this only affects nonlinear)

I think perhaps i need to move, the if(isdying) to underneath the update state chunk
